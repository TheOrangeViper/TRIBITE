Add a bit more flour as necessary but try to keep extra flour at an absolute minimum. Knead until dough is a little bit stretchy, 3 to 5 minutes.",

Use a rolling pin to roll out nice and thin, about 1/8 inch or less. It's ok if the naan is not a perfect circle. You will need extra flour for rolling out as the dough is sticky, but try to use as little as possible.",
            "6. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Transfer dough circles into the hot dry skillet and cook until little bubbles form on the surface and the underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Flip naan over and cook for 1 more minute. Press down slightly with a spatula to increase the heat during cooking. Flip over twice more and cook for an additional 15 seconds per side, but make sure not to overcook to preserve the texture. Naan should still be flexible when you remove it from the skillet onto a plate.",
            "7. Cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm and moist while you cook the other naan breads. Stack all 6 naan breads on top of each other and keep covered with a kitchen towel.",
            "8. When you are finished cooking all 6 naan breads, unstack breads and brush the first naan bread on both sides with a little bit of melted butter. Stack second piece of naan on top and only brush the top side. Keep stacking and buttering all the naan breads. Fold each naan into a triangle and serve."

Create 4 parchment paper handles that will allow you to lift the finished cake out easily (basically two long strips of parchment paper that will run down inside one side of the pan, across the bottom and up the opposite side of the pan. The two strips should cross and form an \"X\" in the at the bottom center of the pan. The strips should be placed underneath the parchment paper being used to line the cake. This way when your cake is finished, you can grip the four handles and lift your cake.",

            "8. Create a water bath. To do this, find a pan that is slightly larger than your cake pan (like an 8 x 8 inch pan). Put your cake inside. Add 1/2 inch of water into a larger baking pan. Make sure your water level is not higher than 1/2 inch (use a ruler if possible).",
            "9. Place cake with the water bath into the oven. Bake for 15 minutes at 338F. Turn the heat down to 320F and cook for another 15 minutes. Turn off heat but leave the cake in the oven to cook for a final 30 minutes. Remove cake from oven and allow it to cool. Cake will shrink slightly while cooling. It can be served right away but it is best to let it set in the fridge for several hours to allow the cheese flavor and sweetness to fully develop. When the cake is first out of the oven, it will have a stronger egg flavor.",
